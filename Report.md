Hardware Mini Project 



Set Up

	For setup, it was required for us to obtain an SD card and any accompanying adapters if needed. Initially, there was some confusion on our part as we had
purchased a regular SD card, unbeknownst to us that they are only compatible with micro SD cards. Installing the OS was fairly simple however, we did run into
trouble due to just being unfamiliar to how our Raspberry Pi’s operate. Understanding that the OS is installed through the SD card which is then inserted into the
Pi and that the lab monitors are utilized as a display for the Pi helped smooth out the process. Initially, we kept brute forcing the install file into the SD card,
not realizing we must open the file package on our personal computer to then have the OS written into the micro SD. Setting up the display and getting the Pi
powered up was rather easy; There were no complications with the Pi and mouse/keyboard user input. Ultimately, the most complicated task for the project was getting
an internet connection established to our Pi. We did not utilize the SSH connection because we did not have an ethernet cable nor did our Macs have ethernet ports.
To avoid the hassle of purchasing another adapter, we decided to go the route of using a wifi hotspot for the entirety of this assignment. We spent several hours
trying to troubleshoot the BU Wifi, however, it didn’t seem like a possibility due its security parameters.
